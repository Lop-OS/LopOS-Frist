## 📖 About LopOS

**LopOS** (derived from "Deve**lop**ers") is a lightweight, high-performance Linux distribution based on **Arch Linux**. It is engineered specifically for developers who need a clean, minimal, and efficient environment to run their projects without the overhead of traditional graphical user interfaces (at least in Phase 1).

> "Stripped of bloat, dedicated to code."

---

## 🚀 Key Features

-   ✅ **Arch Linux Base:** Full access to the Arch User Repository (AUR) and `pacman` package manager.
-   ✅ **Terminal-First Approach (Phase 1):** A powerful Command Line Interface (CLI) focused on performance and resource efficiency.
-   ✅ **Cross-Architecture Support:** Lightweight design ensures it runs on various hardware architectures.
-   ✅ **Dev-Ready:** Pre-configured environment optimized for coding and project deployment.
-   ✅ **Future GUI Support:** A lightweight, custom GUI is planned for Phase 2 updates.
